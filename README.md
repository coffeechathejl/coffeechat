# Mocha Mentor
-> Pitch about Mocha Mentor (hey chat....)

## Inspiration
-> Problem statement
-> Brief Mocha Mentor introduction
-> Mini statement about how Mocha Mentor will be revolutionary

## What it does
Mocha Mentor is a coffee chatting matchmaking system, that pairs mentors and mentees through their LinkedIn profiles, using a sophisticated Machine Learning algorithm. 
-> Can talk about scraping linkedin data, then making the comparison

## How we built it
Mocha Mentor's front end leverages -> I do not specifically know this stack
Auth0 by Otka is used for user authentication and access to the application. -> this sounds atrocious!
The back end leverages the Auth0 apis for generation of unique user ids, MongoDB to store the user's information, and -> lalalala
-> Need to mention the machine learning bit briefly but I do not know much about it

## Challenges we ran into
We initially had some difficulty transforming the response from Auth0 into usable information from our backend. However, with some reconfiguration of our back-end and authorization process, we figured out how to best utilize the data. 

## Accomplishments we're proud of
Challenging ourselves to learn new frameworks and libraries, and pushing through until the very end!

## What we learned
We learned a lot about the importance of good teamwork and clear division of responsibilities. 
-> we def learned some technical stuff and got to experiemtn with front end stuff for the first time. 

## What's next for Mocha Match
We would love to have access to the official LinkedIn profile API so that we can securely retrieve the user's profile information.
